Labs for the course BCDV1002 - Introduction to Blockchain - Security Practices from [Blockchain Development](https://www.georgebrown.ca/programs/blockchain-development-program-t175/) program from [George Brown College](https://www.georgebrown.ca)

## :pencil: Course outline

This course covers a set of security best practices and possible flaws in developing smart contracts.

- ### Lesson 01 - Cryptographic Primitives
    - Randomness, hash functions and signatures.
    - Learn how to create a valid Ethereum address.

- ### Lesson 02 - Blockchain Architecture
    - Transactions, blocks and nodes, interfaces
    - Simulate an Ethereum transaction with [ganache-cli](https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli) and [metamask](https://metamask.io/).

- ### Lesson 03 - Solidity Programming
    - Structure, programming, data-structures
    - Security practices for smart contracts using [remix](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

- ### Lesson 04 - Smart Contract Security
    - Threat models, contract interactions, on-chain randomness, re-entrancy
    - Perform a hack exploring smart contracts flaws.

- ### Lesson 05 - Full Stack Security
    - Input handling, on-chain/off-chain
    - Modify a smart contract and an off-chain program to make them secure preventing replay attacks and cross-contract spends.
